# React Contact Form

**Functionality:**

* Users are able to enter data
* The data is validated either after leaving an input, or on submission
* On submission they are validated that their message was sent okay

**Things to consider:**

**Usability:**

* Mobile first responsive design that works on standard mobile tablet laptop and desktop
* A simple and clean design that makes filling in the form an easy process
* Validation is clear and helpful

**Accessibility:**

* Users can tab through the form
* Form is screen reader friendly
* Colours are colour blind friendly

**Nice to haves:**

Tests would be the next step in improving this contact form, however it is simple and straight forward to test manually so this is low risk for now.
Somewhere to send the data to store it/action on it. Obviously a core point of a contact form but for now I want to focus on data entry and validation.
